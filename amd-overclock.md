# info
- spent the day figuring out amd overclocks this is what i came up with

# unlock gpu settings
- allows overclocking

```shell
sudo nano /etc/default/grub # edit bootloader
```
```
# change this line
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="amdgpu.ppfeaturemask=0xfffd7fff"
```
```
crtl + s #save
crtl + x #exit editor
```
```shell
sudo update-grub && sudo update-grub2 && sudo update-initramfs -u -k all && reboot # update grub and reboot pc
```

- extra info
- amdgpu.ppfeaturemask=0xfffd7fff creates /sys/class/drm/card0/device/pp_od_clk_voltage that you can use for overclocking.
- amdgpu.ppfeaturemask=0xffffffff could also work but has a higher chance to cause issues (mainly RX 470/570)

# setting overclocks and undervolts
## my examples are with vega10 so make sure you read what to do if you are using vega20
## double check card number and hwmon
- example of setting clocks for rx570
```shell
sudo su # enter root user

echo "s 1 1150 890" > /sys/class/drm/card1/device/pp_od_clk_voltage

echo 220 > /sys/class/drm/card1/device/hwmon/hwmon1/pwm1
exit # exit root user

< For Vega10 and previous ASICs >

To manually adjust these settings

first select manual using power_dpm_force_performance_level

Enter a new value for each level by writing a string that contains ???s/m level clock voltage??? to the file

E.g., ???s 1 500 820??? will update sclk level 1 to be 500 MHz at 820 mV;

???m 0 350 810??? will update mclk level 0 to be 350 MHz at 810 mV

When you have edited all of the states as needed, write ???c??? (commit) to the file to commit your changes

If you want to reset to the default power levels, write ???r??? (reset) to the file to reset them.
```
```
< For Vega20 and newer ASICs >
To manually adjust these settings:

    First select manual using power_dpm_force_performance_level

    For clock frequency setting, enter a new value by writing a string that contains ???s/m index clock??? to the file.
    
    The index should be 0 if to set minimum clock. And 1 if to set maximum clock.
    
    E.g., ???s 0 500??? will update minimum sclk to be 500 MHz. ???m 1 800??? will update maximum mclk to be 800Mhz.

    For sclk voltage curve, enter the new values by writing a string that contains ???vc point clock voltage??? to the file. The points are indexed by 0, 1 and 2.
    
    E.g., ???vc 0 300 600??? will update point1 with clock set as 300Mhz and voltage as 600mV.
    
    ???vc 2 1000 1000??? will update point3 with clock set as 1000Mhz and voltage 1000mV.

    When you have edited all of the states as needed, write ???c??? (commit) to the file to commit your changes

    If you want to reset to the default power levels, write ???r??? (reset) to the file to reset them

# card number
- in the above examples i was using card1 ```/sys/class/drm/card1/```
- so double check you are trying to apply settings to the correct card
- also hwmon number will change

```
/sys/class/drm/card1/device/hwmon/hwmon1/pwm1
vs
/sys/class/drm/card0/device/hwmon/hwmon0/pwm1
```
- trouble shooting
```shell
ls /sys/class/drm
```
```
sudo lshw -class display
```

# simple script to set settings
- very simple script you can use or modify to suit your needs.
```
nano oc_script
```
- paste in the script to the oc_script file (right mouse button OR shift + ins)
- edit the variables in the script to correct values (near the top of the script)
- ctrl + s to save
- ctrl + x to exit
```shell
chmod 777 oc_script # allows script to be executable 
```
```shell
sudo ./oc_script # start the script
```
- note you can also add ```view``` at the end of ```./oc_script``` to print some info
```shell
sudo ./oc_script view
```
- next block is the script text to copy and paste into nano
```sh
#!/bin/bash

- sometimes i find i have to run oc after i start mining to apply the fan and memory clock?
- idk why, does any one else?
